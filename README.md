# 1pp
One Pixel Productions improves the BGII inventory icons.</br></br>


## Overview

Without a doubt the most comprehensive mod when it comes to post-release QA and visuals, 1pp has been a growing work of love for close to 8 years with the aim of providing a refined, polished experience with attention to detail that many felt was lacking in some aspects of Baldur's Gate II compared to its predecessor. </br></br>
1ppv4 represents the culmination of this effort, bringing together the various previously disjointed graphical and mechanical tweaks and components that have accumulated over the years and many more besides; updated, streamlined and in the form of one coherent installer.</br></br>

## <a name="101" id="101"></a>[101] 1ppv4: Core paperdolls

Supports: <span style="color:#060">SoA</span>, <span style="color:#700">ToB</span>, <span style="color:#080">Tutu</span>, <span style="color:#088">HoW</span>, <span style="color:#666">IWDII (placeholder)</span></br></br>

<img src="documentation/files/101.jpg"></br>

The component that essentially started it all, this is a port of Baldur's Gate I style paperdolls for the Baldur's Gate II engine (used in SoA/ToB and HoW). Included are reworked 1ppv4 paperdolls for all race/class combinations matching vanilla animations as well as equipped object overlays. New in this version is detection and native support for Infinity Animations, including support for installs of HoW using BG1 animations via the 1pp IWD animation fixpack.

###### Note that this component does not update icon graphics or item colours, so it is not recommended to be installed by itself. It is, however, required for most of the components that follow.</br></br>


## <a name="102" id="102"></a>[102,103]1ppv4: Extended palette entries

<strong>Non-optional component</strong>
Supports: <span style="color:#060">SoA</span>, <span style="color:#700">ToB</span>, <span style="color:#080">Tutu</span>, <span style="color:#088">HoW</span>, <span style="color:#666">IWDII</span></strong></br></br>

This component adds new colour gradients to Infinity Engine games, raising the count of available colours from 116 to 256. It also includes a new random colour table making use of them for Baldur's Gate II and new colour set files for Icewind Dale II, giving you more skin/hair colour choices for the various races.</br></br>
It also fixes a few minor problems with standard gradients. <a href="documentation/files/extpal_readme.html">Read more »</a></br></br>

<strong>Compatibility install [102]</strong></br>
For installs that do not support the binary patch (OSX), this installs the basic files needed for 1pp to work properly but does not support using the new colours as character colours.</br></br>

<strong>Full install [103]</strong></br>
Complete install patching the game executable, enabling full use of the extended colour entries.</br></br>
When installing the full version, extra choices for skin and hair colour will automatically become available from the ingame selection.
As for clothing colours, during character creation and from the inventory the standard complement of 34 primary and secondary colours will be offered. To access more clothing colours, choose 'customise' » 'colours' from the character sheet to gain access to yet another set of 34 colours.</br></br>
