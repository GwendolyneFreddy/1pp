# 1pp
One Pixel Productions improves the BGII inventory icons.</br></br>


## Overview

Without a doubt the most comprehensive mod when it comes to post-release QA and visuals, 1pp has been a growing work of love for close to 8 years with the aim of providing a refined, polished experience with attention to detail that many felt was lacking in some aspects of Baldur's Gate II compared to its predecessor. </br></br>
1ppv4 represents the culmination of this effort, bringing together the various previously disjointed graphical and mechanical tweaks and components that have accumulated over the years and many more besides; updated, streamlined and in the form of one coherent installer.</br></br>

The component that essentially started it all, this is a port of Baldur's Gate I style paperdolls for the Baldur's Gate II engine (used in SoA/ToB and HoW). Included are reworked 1ppv4 paperdolls for all race/class combinations matching vanilla animations as well as equipped object overlays. New in this version is detection and native support for Infinity Animations, including support for installs of HoW using BG1 animations via the 1pp IWD animation fixpack.</br></br>

###### Note that this component does not update icon graphics or item colours, so it is not recommended to be installed by itself. It is, however, required for most of the components that follow.</br></br>
