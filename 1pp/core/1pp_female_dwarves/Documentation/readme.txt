Notes:


Thanks and a big kudos to Mike1072 for the original BGII executable patch making this possible and providing an installer compatible with different versions of the game. 

** Still looking for Mac support, see helpwanted.txt **

Usage:

For some of the changed animations, minor paperdoll edits might be necessary. The installer will update the paperdolls for the concerned animations, and as such should be run after the main paperdoll components have been installed. If installed in the wrong order, manually copying the paperdolls (from the INV directory) to your override will make the correct ones appear.

If you have an older version of this mod installed and don't want to un/reinstall, copying the contents of all directories to your override (except the documentation one, obviously) will properly update your install.
