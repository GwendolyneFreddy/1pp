Includes:

Improved Animation for:
иHuman Female, chainmail(HFB3)

Copy to override.

++

Brings back the BG1-ish sparkles on your chainmail. You couldn't really tell if it was supposed to be plate armour or anything with the solid shading in the stock animations. It also gives your character something to cover her arms and legs.

Seriously.

Also fixes an animation glitch that causes arms to disappear in some battle animations.
