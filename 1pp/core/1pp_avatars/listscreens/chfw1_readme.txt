Improves robe for unarmoured human mages, mainly by changing the skirt back to a character colour (it was using the leather colour for some reason, which you can't set). There were a few colour glitches on the sleeves that have been fixed as well.

Also fixes an animation glitch that causes arms to disappear in some battle animations.
